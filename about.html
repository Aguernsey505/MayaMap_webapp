<h3>About the Project: </h3>
<br>
MayaMap: An Interactive RadioCarbon Map is a comprehensive digital representation of radiocarbon dated artifacts from the Maya civilization in the study area of Belize. While most interactive maps provide very basic information about archaeological sites, MayaMap will give detailed and extensive data on occupation dates and radiocarbon chronologies throughout different sites around Belize, giving a crucial understanding to the temporal aspects of the ancient civilization. By providing this detailed information, MayaMap offers researchers, students, and enthusiasts a valuable new resource for exploring the temporal aspects of Maya civilization. MayaMap will make this complex data more engaging and accessible to researchers, students, and anyone with a general interest in the Maya civilization. Users will be able to explore the map to gain an understanding of the chronological sequence, cultural evolution, and historical significance of Maya sites and civilization.  Additionally, by leveraging open-source data, MayaMap contributes to the broader archaeological community by providing a precedent for sharing and accessing valuable research findings.
